# GiniClust

GiniClust is a clustering method implemented in R for detecting rare cell types from large scale single cell gene expression data. It can be applied to data set come from different platform, such as multiplex qPCR data, tranditional single cell RNAseq or newly emerging UMI-based single cell RNAseq, such as inDrops and Drop-seq. GiniClust is created and maintained by the Yuan Lab at DFCI.

The latest version (v3.0) can be found here: https://github.com/rdong08/GiniClust3 


# Preparation
Download the zip file GiniClust.zip and unzip it.  The unzipped folder contains one script 'Giniclust_Main.R', one folder 'Rfunction' including R scripts for all functions and two data samples 'Data_GBM.csv' (an RNAseq dataset) and 'Data_qPCR.csv' (a qPCR dataset).

Make sure 'Giniclust_Main.R', 'Rfunction' and input data are all saved in the same directory.

# Input File Format
The input file is a gene expression matrix in the csv format.
Specifically, for qPCR data, each entry is log2 gene expression level; for RNAseq data, each entry is UMI-Count/Cell or Raw-Read-Count/Cell.  The first row contains cell IDs. The first column contains unique gene names. 

For example, in R 
```R
>ExprM.RawCounts  <- read.csv("Data_GBM.csv", sep=",", head=T)
>ExprM.RawCounts[1:4,1:4]
```
you can take a look at one of our test dataset:

|Table   |MGH26 | MGH26.1 | MGH26.2 | MGH26.3|
|------------ |------------| -------------|------------ | -------------|
|1/2-SBSRNA4| 0      |47       |0       |0|
|A1BG          | 41      |80       |3       |0|
|A1BG-AS1        |0       |0       |0      |0|
|A1CF            |0       |0       |0       |0|

# Usage 
    Rscript Giniclust_Main.R [options]

Options:
- -f CHARACTER or  --file=CHARACTER, input dataset file name 
- -t CHARACTER or --type=CHARACTER, input dataset type: choose from 'qPCR' or 'RNA-seq' 
- -o CHARACTER or  --out=CHARACTER, output folder name [default= results]
- -h or  --help, Show help message and exit

For example, the following command is used to analyze the 'Data_GBM.csv' dataset
```sh
$ Rscript GiniClust_Main.R -f Data_GBM.csv -t RNA-seq -o GBM_results
```
The following command is used to analyze the 'Data_qPCR.csv' dataset. 
```sh
$ Rscript GiniClust_Main.R -f Data_qPCR.csv -t qPCR -o  qPCR_results
```


# Results
Two folders will be created by GiniClust in the current directory: 
the first one is the output folder which includes all relevant figures and tables, including:
- Dataname_rawCounts.csv: the raw counts 
- Dataname_normCounts.csv: the normalized counts
- Dataname_gene.expression.matrix.RawCounts.filtered.csv: the raw counts after filtering 
- Dataname_gene.expression.matrix.normCounts.filtered.csv: the normalized counts after filtering  
- Gini_related_table_RNA-seq.csv: the table related with Gini index for RNA-seq data
- Gini_related_table_qPCR.csv: the table related with Gini index for qPCR data
- Dataname_clusterID.csv: clustering result, the first column represents cell IDs and the second column is the corresponding cluster result for each cell.
- Dataname_Rtnse_coord2.csv: coordinates of cells in tSNE plot 
- Dataname_bi-directional.GiniIndexTable.csv: For qPCR data the table of bidirectional Gini index
- RareCluster_lrTest.csv: lrTest results by MAST analysis for RNA-seq data 
- RareCluster.diff.gene.t-test.results.csv t-test results for qPCR data
sub-folder 'figures':
